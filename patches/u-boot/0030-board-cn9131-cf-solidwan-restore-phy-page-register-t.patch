Subject: [PATCH 30/31] board: cn9131-cf-solidwan: restore phy page register to
 fix Linux probe

Linux can't know which phy driver to start without reading ID registers
on page 0. When U-Boot leaves the page register set to a different page
Linux fails to identify the phy, and later to bind mac and phy.

Restore the page register after phy configuration in board-file is
complete.
